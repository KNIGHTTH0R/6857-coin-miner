    This is a bare-bones miner compatible with 857coin, minus the final proof of
    work check. We have left lots of opportunities for optimization. Partial
    credit will be awarded for successfully mining any block that appends to
    a tree rooted at the genesis block. Full credit will be awarded for mining
    a block that adds to the main chan. Note that the faster you solve the proof
    of work, the better your chances are of landing in the main chain.

    Feel free to modify this code in any way, or reimplement it in a different
    language or on specialized hardware.

    Good luck!
